## Signature Achievement: AI-Powered QMS Platform

### The Challenge
Manufacturing organizations struggle with:
- 📋 **Audit Overload**: 100s of audits/year with manual processes
- 🔍 **Knowledge Silos**: Procedures and expertise scattered
- ⏱️ **Reactive Quality**: Finding issues too late
- 📊 **Compliance Burden**: Regulatory documentation overhead

### My Solution

### Technical Highlights

| Component | Technology | Impact |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Knowledge RAG** | Hybrid search, domain embeddings | 90% question coverage |
| **Similar Case Finder** | Vector similarity, ML ranking | 60% faster RCA |
| **Checklist Generation** | LLM + procedural grounding | 50% prep time reduction |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regulatory RAG + change detection | Always audit-ready |

### Architecture Principles I Applied

1. **Grounding over Hallucination**
   - Every AI response cites sources
   - Confidence scoring on recommendations
   - Human-in-loop for critical decisions

2. **Multi-Tenancy by Design**
   - Organization → Site → Department hierarchy
   - Isolated vector namespaces per tenant
   - Tenant-aware prompts and fine-tuning

3. **Regulatory Compliance First**
   - FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant
   - Full audit trails for AI interactions
   - Explainable AI for regulated processes

## My GenAI Design Philosophy

### The 4 Pillars

│  1. GROUNDED INTELLIGENCE                               │
│     "AI should enhance, not replace, human judgment"    │
│     • Always show sources and reasoning                 │
│     • Confidence scores, not certainties                │
│     • Graceful degradation when uncertain               │
│                                                          │
│  2. PRODUCTION-FIRST MINDSET                            │
│     "Demo magic ≠ Production reality"                   │
│     • Design for failure modes from day 1               │
│     • Cost and latency are features                     │
│     • Observability is non-negotiable                   │
│                                                          │
│  3. PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY                              │
│     "Start simple, evolve with evidence"                │
│     • RAG before agents                                 │
│     • Prompting before fine-tuning                      │
│     • Validate assumptions at each step                 │
│                                                          │
│  4. HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION                              │
│     "AI augments, humans decide"                        │
│     • Clear escalation paths                            │
│     • Feedback loops for improvement                    │
│     • User control over AI behavior                     │
│                                                          │

## Key Talking Points to Emphasize

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Personalize These With Your Specific Examples**

### When discussing architecture:
- "I prioritize production readiness over demo-ability..."
- "In regulated environments, I learned that auditability is a first-class requirement..."
- "My approach to multi-tenancy ensures data isolation without sacrificing shared learning..."

### When discussing trade-offs:
- "I evaluated GPT-4 vs Claude vs open-source based on these criteria..."
- "We chose RAG over fine-tuning because our data changed frequently..."
- "Caching gave us 40% cost reduction while maintaining quality..."

### When discussing failures/learnings:
- "Our first agent implementation taught me the importance of iteration limits..."
- "We underestimated prompt injection risks initially, then built a comprehensive defense..."
- "The migration from POC to production revealed these scaling challenges..."
